SoundcloudRater
===============

This is the repository for my webpage and script that will dynamically rate and sort songs on soundcloud based on popularity and reception

TODO:
Implement count of each song
Detection of duplicate songs with diff urls
Put all of the checkEntry into one regex
Exclude sets by checking tracktype and track duration
